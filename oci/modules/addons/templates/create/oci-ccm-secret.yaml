  # SecurityListManagementMode configures how security lists are managed by the CCM.
  #   "All" (default): Manage all required security list rules for load balancer services.
  #   "Frontend":      Manage only security list rules for ingress to the load
  #                    balancer. Requires that the user has setup a rule that
  #                    allows inbound traffic to the appropriate ports for kube
  #                    proxy health port, node port ranges, and health check port ranges.
  #                    E.g. 10.82.0.0/16 30000-32000.
  #   "None":          Disables all security list management. Requires that the
  #                    user has setup a rule that allows inbound traffic to the
  #                    appropriate ports for kube proxy health port, node port
  #                    ranges, and health check port ranges. E.g. 10.82.0.0/16 30000-32000.
  #                    Additionally requires the user to mange rules to allow
  #                    inbound traffic to load balancers.
